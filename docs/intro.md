Welcome to the Diffbot docs! Here you'll learn all about Diffbot's features and how they can help you accomplish your goal.

## Getting Started

To begin, please make sure you've registered for an API account at [Diffbot.com](https://diffbot.com) - we have two-week trials available which are identical to paid accounts in almost every way except crawling ability. If you want to test crawls, please [get in touch](mailto:support@diffbot.com) and we'll give you a temporary account boost.

## Categories and Sections

The categories are divided into isolated collections of content focused on a specific skill level. **Tutorials** are good for newbies, but someone who has grasped the basics and knows what they are looking for will feel more at home in the **How To Guides**, reading specific solutions to specific problems. If you're interested in the philosophy or technology behind some of the features or choices we at Diffbot have made, there's the **Explainers** category.

## API and Errors

To read our API docs, visit the separate [API Section](api-intro). You'll usually consult it to find out which commands you can run, fields you can include, searches you can run, to inspect demo queries, and so on. We recommend you dive into the API reference only once you've gone through the prose sections, but if you're technical enough and just want to get your hands dirty, feel free to dive right in!

If you're already experimenting with our APIs but are running into problems, please consult the [Debugging](error-intro) section and if that doesn't help, [let us know](mailto:support@diffbot.com)!
