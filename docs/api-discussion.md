title: Discussion Extraction API
sidebar_label: Discussion Extraction API
---

The Discussion API automatically structures and extracts entire threads or lists of reviews/comments from most discussion pages, forums, and similarly structured web pages.

## Request

To use the Discussion Thread API, perform a HTTP GET request on the following endpoint:

```plaintext
https://api.diffbot.com/v3/discussion
```

Provide the following arguments:

| Argument | Description |
| :------- | :---------- |
| `token` | Developer token |
| `url` | Web page URL of the discussion to process (URL encoded) </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">**Optional arguments**</td> |
| `fields` | Used to specify optional fields to be returned by the Discussion API. See the [Fields](#the-fields-argument) section below. |
| `timeout` | Sets a value in milliseconds to wait for the retrieval/fetch of content from the requested URL. The default timeout for the third-party response is 30 seconds (30000). |
| `callback` | Use for jsonp requests. Needed for cross-domain ajax. |
| `maxPages` | Set the maximum number of pages in a thread to automatically concatenate in a single response. Default = 1 (no concatenation). Set `maxPages=all` to retrieve all pages of a thread regardless of length. Each individual page will count as a separate API call. |
| `proxy` | Used to specify the IP address of a custom proxy that will be used to fetch the target page, instead of Diffbot's default IPs/proxies. (Ex: `&proxy=168.212.226.204`) |
| `proxyAuth` | Used to specify the authentication parameters that will be used with the proxy specified in the `&proxy` parameter. (Ex: `&proxyAuth=username:password`) |

### The fields argument

Use the `fields` argument to return optional fields in the JSON response. The default fields will always be returned. For nested arrays, use parentheses to retrieve specific fields, or `*` to return all sub-fields.

For example, to return `meta` (in addition to the default fields), your `&fields` argument would be:

```plaintext
&fields=meta
```

## Response

The Discussion API returns data in JSON format.

Each V3 response includes a `request` object (which returns request-specific metadata), and an `objects` array, which will include the extracted information for all objects on a submitted page. The Discussion API returns all post data in a single object within the `objects` array.

Within the Article and Product APIs (to extract comments or review data), discussion data will be returned within the nested `discussion` object.

The Discussion API `objects` / `discussion` response will include the following fields:

| Field | Description |
| :---- | :---------- |
| `type` | Type of object (always `discussion`). |
| `pageUrl` | URL of submitted page / page from which the discussion is extracted. |
| `resolvedPageUrl` | Returned if the `pageUrl` redirects to another URL. |
| `title` | Title of the discussion. |
| `numPosts` | Number of individual posts in the thread. |
| `posts` | Array of individual posts. |
| &#x21B3;`type` | Type of element (always `post`). |
| &#x21B3;`id` | ID of the individual post. The first post of a thread will have an ID of 0. |
| &#x21B3;`parentId` | ID of the parent, if the post is a reply or response. |
| &#x21B3;`text` | Full text of the extracted post. |
| &#x21B3;`html` | Diffbot-normalized HTML of the extracted post. Please see the [HTML Specification](api-article-html.md) for a breakdown of elements and attributes returned. |
| &#x21B3;`tags` | If the post is long enough, an array of tags generated from its specific content. |
| &#x21B3;`humanLanguage` | Spoken/human language of the post, using two-letter [ISO 639-1 nomenclature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes). |
| &#x21B3;`images` | If any images are detected within post content, they will be returned in a separate array. Individual array fields are the same as the [Article API's](api-article.md) `images` array. |
| &#x21B3;`date` | Date of post, normalized in most cases to [RFC 1123 (HTTP/1.1)](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.3). |
| &#x21B3;`author` | Name/username of the post author. |
| &#x21B3;`authorUrl` | URL of the author profile page, if available. |
| &#x21B3;`pageUrl` | URL of the page on which the post was found. |
| &#x21B3;`diffbotUri` | Internal ID used for indexing. |
| `tags` | Array of tags/entities as generated from analysis of all extracted `posts` and cross-referenced with [DBpedia](https://wiki.dbpedia.org/About) and other data sources. |
| `participants` | Number of unique participants in the discussion thread or comments. |
| `numPages` | Number of pages in the thread concatenated to form the `posts` response. Use `maxPages` to define how many pages to concatenate. [More on automatic concatenation](guides-multi-page-articles-discussions.md). |
| `nextPage` | If discussion spans multiple pages, `nextPage` will return the subsequent page URL. |
| `nextPages` | Array of all page URLs concatenated in a multipage discussion. [More on automatic concatenation](guides-multi-page-articles-discussions.md). |
| `provider` | Discussion service provider (e.g., Disqus, Facebook), if known. |
| `humanLanguage` | Spoken/human language of the discussion / comment thread, using two-letter [ISO 639-1 nomenclature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes). |
| `rssUrl` | URL of the discussion's RSS feed, if available. |
| `diffbotUri` | Unique object ID. The `diffbotUri` is generated from the values of various Discussion fields and uniquely identifies the object. This can be used for deduplication. </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">**Optional fields, available using `fields=` argument**</td> |
| `sentiment` | Returns a sentiment score of each individual post, a value ranging from -1.0 (very negative) to 1.0 (very positive). |
| `links` | Returns a top-level object (`links`) containing all hyperlinks found on the page. |
| `meta` | Returns a top-level object (`meta`) containing the full contents of page `meta` tags, including sub-arrays for [OpenGraph](https://ogp.me/) tags, [Twitter Card](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/markup) metadata, [schema.org](https://www.schema.org) microdata, and -- if available -- [oEmbed](https://www.oembed.com) metadata. |
| `querystring` | Returns any key/value pairs present in the URL querystring. Items without a discrete value will be returned as `true`. |
| `breadcrumb` | Returns a top-level array (`breadcrumb`) of URLs and link text from page breadcrumbs. |

## Authentication

You can supply Diffbot with basic authentication credentials or custom HTTP headers (see below) to access intranet pages or other sites that require a login.

### Basic Authentication

To access pages that require a login/password (using [basic access authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)), include the username and password in your `url` parameter, e.g.: `url=http%3A%2F%2FUSERNAME:PASSWORD@www.diffbot.com`.

## Custom HTTP Headers and JavaScript

> See here for a full guide on [using custom headers in direct API calls](guides-custom-headers-api).

### Custom headers

You can supply Diffbot APIs with custom HTTP headers that will be passed along when making requests to third-party sites. These can be used to define specific Referer, User-Agent, Cookie or any other values.

Custom headers should be sent as HTTP headers in your request to `https://api.diffbot.com`, and prepended with `X-Forward-`.

For instance, to send custom `User-Agent`, `Referer` and `My-Custom-Header` header values:

| Desired Header | Send to api.diffbot.com |
| :-- | :-- |
| `User-Agent:Diffbot` | `X-Forward-User-Agent:Diffbot` |
| `Referer:diffbot.com` | `X-Forward-Referer:diffbot.com` |
| `My-Custom-Header:CustomValue` | `X-Forward-My-Custom-Header:CustomValue` |

### Custom Javascript

<div class="alert">This functionality is currently in beta.</div>

Using the `X-Evaluate` custom header (sent as `X-Forward-X-Evaluate`), you can inject your own Javascript code into web pages. Custom Javascript will be executed once the DOM has loaded.

Custom Javascript should be provided as a text string and contained in its own function. You must also include the special functions `start()` and `end()` to indicate the beginning and end of your custom script. Once `end()` fires, the updated document will be processed by your chosen extraction API.

It's recommended that your `end()` function be offset using `setTimeout` (see [JavaScript Timing Events](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_timing.asp)) in order to accommodate your primary function processing. Additionally, if your custom Javascript requires access to Ajax-delivered content, it may be necessary to offset your entire function using `setTimeout` in order to delay the start of your processing.

The following sample `X-Evaluate` header waits one-half second after the DOM has loaded, enacts a click on the `a.loadMore` element, then waits 800 milliseconds before signaling the `end()`:


```js
function() {
    start();
    setTimeout(function() {
        var loadMoreNode = document.querySelector('a.loadMore');
        if (loadMoreNode != null) {
            loadMoreNode.click();
            setTimeout(function() {
                end();
            }, 800);
        } else {
            end();
        }
    }, 500);
}
```

Delivered as a string value as a custom header:

```json
"X-Forward-X-Evaluate": "function() {start();setTimeout(function(){var loadMoreNode=document.querySelector('a.loadMore');if (loadMoreNode != null) {loadMoreNode.click();setTimeout(function(){end();}, 800);} else {end();}},500);}"
```

## Posting Content

If your content is not publicly available (e.g., behind a firewall), you can POST markup directly to the Discussion API endpoint for analysis:

```plaintext
https://api.diffbot.com/v3/discussion?token=...&url=...
```

Please note that the `url` argument is still required, and will be used to resolve any relative links contained in the markup.

Provide the content to analyze as your POST body, and specify the `Content-Type` header as `text/html`.
