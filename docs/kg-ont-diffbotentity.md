  The month over month growth of wikipediaPageviews, where we count the increment of the number of page views of the second to last (full) month, compared with that of the last (full) month. if today was Aug 16th, 2022, the last complete month is July. So it refers to the increment from June to July, i.e., ( f(July) - f(June) ) Ã· f(June) x 100%. The f(.) only counts the first 28 days of a month, to avoid fluctuations between 31-days months like Jan and 28(29)-days months like Feb.

### wikipediaPageviewsLastQuarterGrowth
  The quarter over quarter growth of wikipediaPageviews, where we count the increment of the number of page views of the second to last (full) quarter, compared with that of the last (full) quarter. If today was Aug 16th, 2022, the last complete quarter is Q2 (April, May, June). So it refers to the increment from Q1 to Q2, i.e., ( f(Q2) - f(Q1) ) Ã· f(Q1) x 100%.
* **Type:** Float
* **Example:**
```
{
	"wikipediaPageviewsLastQuarterGrowth": ""

### wikipediaPageviewsLastYearGrowth
  The year over year growth of wikipediaPageviews, where we count the monthly-rolling increment of the year before last than the last year. It today was Aug 16th, 2022, it is computed by comparing the numbers from Aug 2021 to July 2022 and from Aug 2020 to July 2021, i.e., ( f(Aug 2021 to July 2022) - f(Aug 2020 to July 2021) ) Ã· f(Aug 2020 to July 2021) x 100%.
