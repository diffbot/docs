The Diffbot Knowledge Graph (KG) is a collection of over 10 billion standard entities (697M+ people, 200M+ companies, 2.2M+ articles, 2.8M+ products, and more) [crawled](cb-intro-cb.md) and [extracted](api-basics-index.md) by Diffbot from the public web. 

**How it Works —** [Search](kg-search-quickstart.md) for any entity, or [Enhance]() your existing dataset of companies and people with facts from the Knowledge Graph. Both are available as REST API endpoints, though access via the [Dashboard]() interface may be preferred for less technical users.

**Highlights —** A unique benefit of the Diffbot Knowledge Graph is its ability to support a staggering array of search queries. Here are some examples (Diffbot account required to view):

- [Companies in San Francisco with a Female CEO and <500 Employees]()
- [All Whole Foods Retail Store Locations]()
- [People in Automotive Software Roles Based in Europe]()
- [Recent Founders Who Were Previously FAANG Employees]()
- [Largest Investors in Video Game Companies]()
- [Positive Sentiment News on COVID-19]()
- [News Coverage of Protests by Publishing Country]()

Additionally, unlike other datasets, Knowledge Graph records can also be updated and refreshed on demand. This is currently supported as a beta feature for organizations and people through [Enhance Refresh & Search](). *As of Q1 2021, we are actively improving this feature.*


## Getting Started

[Quickstart with Search]() is a 9 minute guide to finding companies and news/blog articles with the Knowledge Graph. Start with Search if you're looking to build a dataset similar to the ones highlighted in the section above.

If you're looking instead to enrich your existing organization/people dataset with data like industries, logos, past employment, skills and more, [Quickstart with Enhance]() should be perfect for you.

None of the above quite what you're looking for? Try [Extract](), our automatic scraping API for any website.
