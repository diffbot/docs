		<p>We do not provide PDF invoices, but in the <a href="https://app.diffbot.com/diffbot-users/billing/">Developer Dashboard</a>, under Account &gt; Billing History, you may view past receipts or view a version suitable for printing.</p>
<p>Depending on your browser and/or operating system, you will likely be able to save-as or print-as a PDF.</p>
