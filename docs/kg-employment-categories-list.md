Employment categories (see [employments ontology reference](kg-ont-person#employments)) are canonicalized Domains, Seniority, and/or Roles inferred from a given person's employment title and description. Employment categories are only applicable for the [Person data type](kg-ont-person).

* **Domain** categories reflect career types (e.g. *Human Resources*, or *Food Preparation*)
* **Role** categories describe specialized job types, and are often indicative of rank (e.g. *Manager*, *CEO*)
* **Seniority** categories indicate a person's relative experience (e.g. *Junior*, or *Senior*)

A given employment may have one or several attributed categories. 

This reference is helpful for narrowing down queries for person employments on the [Diffbot Knowledge Graph](dql-quickstart) where inconsistent titles might be used, such as *Engineer* or *Software Developer*, both of which will be attributed the domain category *Engineering, IT and Software Development*. 

An example [DQL](dql-index) query using an employment category on this list might look like this â€”

```python
# Query for engineering managers
type:Person employment.{categories:"Engineering, IT and Software Development" categories:"Manager" isCurrent:true}
```
