Have you run into a problem where the Diffbot extraction from a particular site is incorrect or needs adjusting? Our [API customization dashboard](tutorials-new-dashboard) not only allows you to create new APIs entirely, but also to override or correct the output returned by our Automatic APIs.

Correcting a fieldâ€™s output takes immediate effect for your account, and also serves to train our system, improving Diffbot extraction over the long run.

Learn how to use it in the [Custom API Tutorial](api-basics-custom).
