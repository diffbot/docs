The Event API automatically extracts data from any single entity event page. Retrieve full event information, dates, location and address information, images and event descriptions.

## Request

To use the Event API, perform a HTTP GET request on the following endpoint:

```plaintext
https://api.diffbot.com/v3/event
```

Provide the following arguments:

| Argument | Description |
| :------- | :---------- |
| `token` | Developer token |
| `url` | Web page URL of the event to process (URL encoded) </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">**Optional arguments**</td> |
| `fields` | Used to specify optional fields to be returned by the Event API. See the [Fields](#the-fields-argument) section below. |
| `timeout` | Sets a value in milliseconds to wait for the retrieval/fetch of content from the requested URL. The default timeout for the third-party response is 30 seconds (30000). |
| `callback` | Use for jsonp requests. Needed for cross-domain ajax. |
| `proxy` | Leave value empty to use default proxies, or specify an IP address of a custom proxy that will be used to fetch the target page, instead of Diffbot's default IPs/proxies. (Ex: `&proxy` or `&proxy=168.212.226.204`) |
| `proxyAuth` | Used to specify the authentication parameters that will be used with a custom proxy specified in the `&proxy` parameter. (Ex: `&proxyAuth=username:password`) |

### The fields argument

Use the `fields` argument to return optional fields in the JSON response. The default fields will always be returned. For nested arrays, use parentheses to retrieve specific fields, or `*` to return all sub-fields.

For example, to return `links` and `meta` (in addition to the default fields), your `&fields` argument would be:</p>

```plaintext
&fields=links,meta
```

## Response

The Event API returns data in JSON format.

Each V3 response includes a `request` object (which returns request-specific metadata), and an `objects` array, which will include the extracted information for all objects on a submitted page.

Objects in the Event API's `objects` array will include the following fields:

| Field | Description |
| :---- | :---------- |
| `type` | Type of object (always `event`). |
| `pageUrl` | URL of submitted page / page from which the event is extracted. |
| `resolvedPageUrl` | Returned if the `pageUrl` redirects to another URL. |
| `title` | Title of the event. |
| `startDate` | Start date of extracted event in GMT, normalized in most cases to [RFC 1123 (HTTP/1.1)](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.3). If no start time was found, the time is midnight.|
| `endDate` | End date of extracted event in GMT, normalized in most cases to [RFC 1123 (HTTP/1.1)](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.3). If no end time was found, the time is midnight.|
| `startDateLocalTimezone` | Start date of extracted event in the local timezone as deplayed on the page. If no start time was found, the time is midnight.|
| `endDateLocalTimezone` | End date of extracted eventin the local timezone as deplayed on the page. If no start time was found, the time is midnight.|
|`timezoneOffset` | GMT offset in hours and minutes.|
| `description` | Text description, if available, of the event. |
| `venue` | The name of the venue, if available. |
| `location` | Parsed location information, if a parsable location was found.|
| &#x21B3;`country` | Country name.|
| &#x21B3;`isCurrent` | Returns true if the address is current. |
| &#x21B3;`address` | The complete location address as a normalized string. |
| &#x21B3;`city` | City name. |
| &#x21B3;`street` | Street address. |
| &#x21B3;`subregion` | Subregion of the city or area, such as a county. |
| &#x21B3;`latitude` | Latitude of the geographic coordinate of the address. |
| &#x21B3;`longitude` | Longitude of the geographic coordinate of the address. |
| &#x21B3;`postalCode` | Postal code. |
| &#x21B3;`region` | Region, such as a state or province. |
| &#x21B3;`precision` | The scale of the area described by the address. More specific addresses describe a smaller area and will have a lower value. |
| `images` | Array of images, if present within the event page. |
| &#x21B3;`url` |Fully resolved link to image. If the image `SRC` is encoded as base64 data, the complete data URI will be returned. |
| &#x21B3;`title` | Description or caption of the image. |
| &#x21B3;`height` | Height of image as (re-)sized via browser/CSS. |
| &#x21B3;`width` | Width of image as (re-)sized via browser/CSS. |
| &#x21B3;`naturalHeight` | Raw image height, in pixels. |
| &#x21B3;`naturalWidth` | Raw image width, in pixels. |
| &#x21B3;`primary` | Returns `true` if image is identified as primary based on visual analysis. |
| &#x21B3;`xpath` | XPath expression identifying the image node. |
| &#x21B3;`diffbotUri` | Internal ID used for indexing. |
| `humanLanguage` | Returns the (spoken/human) language of the submitted page, using two-letter [ISO 639-1 nomenclature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes). |
| `meta` | Returns a top-level object (`meta`) containing the full contents of page `meta` tags, including sub-arrays for [OpenGraph](https://ogp.me/) tags, [Twitter Card](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/markup) metadata, [schema.org](https://www.schema.org) microdata, and -- if available -- [oEmbed](https://www.oembed.com) metadata. |
| `diffbotUri` | Unique object ID. The `diffbotUri` is generated from the values of various event fields and uniquely identifies the object. This can be used for deduplication.|

## Authentication

You can supply Diffbot with basic authentication credentials or custom HTTP headers (see below) to access intranet pages or other sites that require a login.

### Basic Authentication

To access pages that require a login/password (using [basic access authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)), include the username and password in your `url` parameter, e.g.: `url=http%3A%2F%2FUSERNAME:PASSWORD@www.diffbot.com`.

## Custom HTTP Headers

You can supply Diffbot APIs with custom HTTP headers that will be passed along when making requests to third-party sites. These can be used to define specific Referer, User-Agent, Cookie or any other values.

Custom headers should be sent as HTTP headers in your request to `https://api.diffbot.com`, and prepended with `X-Forward-`.

For instance, to send custom `User-Agent`, `Referer` and `My-Custom-Header` header values:

| Desired Header | Send to api.diffbot.com |
| :-- | :-- |
| `User-Agent:Diffbot` | `X-Forward-User-Agent:Diffbot` |
| `Referer:diffbot.com` | `X-Forward-Referer:diffbot.com` |
| `My-Custom-Header:CustomValue` | `X-Forward-My-Custom-Header:CustomValue` |

## Custom Javascript

<div class="alert">This functionality is currently in beta.</div>

Using the `X-Evaluate` custom header (sent as `X-Forward-X-Evaluate`), you can inject your own Javascript code into web pages. Custom Javascript will be executed once the DOM has loaded.

Custom Javascript should be provided as a text string and contained in its own function. You must also include the special functions `start()` and `end()` to indicate the beginning and end of your custom script. Once `end()` fires, the updated document will be processed by your chosen extraction API.

It's recommended that your `end()` function be offset using `setTimeout` (see [JavaScript Timing Events](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_timing.asp)) in order to accommodate your primary function processing. Additionally, if your custom Javascript requires access to Ajax-delivered content, it may be necessary to offset your entire function using `setTimeout` in order to delay the start of your processing.

The following sample `X-Evaluate` header waits one-half second after the DOM has loaded, enacts a click on the `a.loadMore` element, then waits 800 milliseconds before signaling the `end()`:


```js
function() {
    start();
    setTimeout(function() {
        var loadMoreNode = document.querySelector('a.loadMore');
        if (loadMoreNode != null) {
            loadMoreNode.click();
            setTimeout(function() {
                end();
            }, 800);
        } else {
            end();
        }
    }, 500);
}
```

Delivered as a string value as a custom header:

```json
"X-Forward-X-Evaluate": "function() {start();setTimeout(function(){var loadMoreNode=document.querySelector('a.loadMore');if (loadMoreNode != null) {loadMoreNode.click();setTimeout(function(){end();}, 800);} else {end();}},500);}"
```

> Note: X-Evaluate will only be executed if called from the API the rule resides in. If you have an X-Evaluate script in your Article API rule and make a request with the Analyze API that identifies the page as an article, the X-Evaluate will not be executed.

## Posting Content

If your content is not publicly available (e.g., behind a firewall), you can POST markup directly to the Event API endpoint for analysis:

```plaintext
https://api.diffbot.com/v3/event?token=...&url=...
```

Please note that the `url` argument is still required, and will be used to resolve any relative links contained in the markup.

Provide the content to analyze as your POST body, and specify the `Content-Type` header as `text/html`.

### HTML Post Sample

```plaintext
curl -H "Content-Type: text/html" -d '<html><head><title>Some Event Name</title></head><body><h2>Come join us on February 22nd, 2020</h2><div> at the Chase Center, 1301 2nd Ave, Seattle, WA 98101</div></body></html>' 'https://api.diffbot.com/v3/event?token=...&url=http%3A%2F%2Fstore.diffbot.com'
```
